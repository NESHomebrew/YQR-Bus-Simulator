# YQR-Bus-Simulator
Simple game built in Processing for CTCH204

**INSPIRED BY REAL LIFE EVENTS**

A classmate having first-hand experience, commented on how buses in this city tend to hit a lot of people and never seem to suffer the consequences other than minor traffic violations. This game aims to simulate that experience. 

You are the bus driver. You may choose to go for a Low Score, or HighScore. Controls use either WASD or directional keys.
